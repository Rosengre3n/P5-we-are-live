Unreal Engine 4 textures info

Each folder contains two sets of textures for LOD 0 and LOD 1.
"T" is standarized prefix describing Unreal Engine 4 asset as a texture.
Names of textures provided by us contain suffixes describing their use.
The convention is following:
 
BC - Base Color
N - Normal
AO_R_MT - Ambient Occlusion (red channel), Roughness (green channel), Metallic (blue channel)
